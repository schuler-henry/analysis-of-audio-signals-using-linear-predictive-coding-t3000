# Analysis of Audio Signals Using Linear Predictive Coding
This study deals with audio signal feature extraction in order to be used for speaker authentication using a neuronal network.
Specifically, the effectiveness of linear predictive coding (LPC) coefficients is examined.
The goal of this study is to explain how linear predictive coefficients can be extracted and to evaluate whether they can be used to differentiate between multiple speakers.
